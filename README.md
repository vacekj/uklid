Uklid (pronounced `[uÀêkl…™t]`, "cleanup" in Czech) is an interactive CLI `node_modules` cleaner written in Rust.
It looks for top-level node_modules in your computer, shows you their size and allows you to delete them conveniently.

## Features
- recursively search your home directory for `node_modules`
- limit search to a specific directory
- show sizes
- multi-select what you want to delete
- show total storage freed up

## Roadmap
- tests with 100% coverage
- multi-threaded searching and cleaning
- accept command-line arguments (non-interactive mode)
- a GUI
