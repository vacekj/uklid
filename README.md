Uklid (pronounced `[uÀêkl…™t]`, "cleanup" in Czech) is an interactive CLI `node_modules` cleaner written in Rust.
It looks for top-level node_modules in your computer, shows you their size and allows you to delete them conveniently.

## Installation
```bash
cargo install uklid
```

## Usage
```bash
uklid 0.2.0
Atris <vacekj@outlook.com>
Interactively delete node_modules.

Run without options for interactive mode

USAGE:
    uklid [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -d, --dry            Don't delete anything, only print found directories
    -h, --help           Print help information
    -p, --path <PATH>    Path to start recursive search for node_modules from
    -V, --version        Print version information

```

## Features
- recursively search your home directory for `node_modules`
- limit search to a specific directory
- show sizes
- multi-select what you want to delete
- show total storage freed up
- non-interactive mode (`uklid --help`)
- high test coverage for both interactive and non-interactive mode

## Roadmap
- Filter or sort results by size and last modify date (only delete old, unused node_modules)
- better searching algorithm
- multi-threaded searching and cleaning
